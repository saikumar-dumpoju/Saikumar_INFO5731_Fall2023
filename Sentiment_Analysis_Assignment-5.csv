1,"This phone was a last resort. I had a completely failed experience with another seller’s IPhone 11, and to be honest, I was extremely nervous when ordering this one. The reviews had been 50/50, so I had very little clue what I was going to get.The package arrived a day early, which was nice and unexpected. My phone was put into what seemed like a generic Android phone box, which, I’ll let you know damn near gave me a heart attack when I opened.Inside were a few things. An Amazon renewed card and one other thing I can’t remember- as well as the phone (obviously) and a charger and charging brick. Charger and charging brick are standard but the cable feels pretty nice and the brick is a good size. Standard plastic holder inside. Nothing more, nothing less. No complaints.For the actual phone, it was inside of a plastic zip bag. The bag itself was scratched up so it was difficult to see the phone inside until i took it out. The first thing I did when I took it out was inspect it for damage. I was completely ready to pack it back up and send it back- but I was pleasantly surprised.The phone had very little cosmetic damage, just some scratches on the frame (my case covers it anyways, so it doesn’t matter to me) and literally no screen damage- besides a little scratch on the upper right corner near the bezel. And you have to remember these phones are used, so I didn’t feel a need to dock a star for that, since you can only see the scratch when the screen is off and light is being reflected onto it. Overall, 9.5/10 for cosmetics.Then, the battery. My particular phone came with 80% battery health, which I personally don’t mind. I have the means to be able to get it replaced when the time comes, and to be honest was a relief after my last IPhone 11 from another seller had 100% battery health, just for it to be a non-Apple battery and cause all sorts of problems.Overall, I have no complaints with this phone. It’s in great condition in my book. Mic, speakers, cameras, haptics, everything (as far as I’ve been using it) has been in perfect order. Based on other reviews, whatever phone you get from this seller honestly depends on luck. It’s trivial, and that should never be the case, but if you can, I’d say take the risk. Worse case scenario you return it and get a full refund and try again.Overall, I’m very happy with my purchase.Read more",Good

3,"It's GORGEOUS!!  I am totally impressed with everything. From purchase to delivery, to product. I was expecting there to be at least a little blemish, somewhere on the phone but, this thing looks like it was never used.  It came in quality packaging with brand new charging equipment and a sim key.  I've had it 1 month now.  The battery life is mind blowing.  I'm still trying to get used to navigating and learning all the features it offers (I went from an iPhone 7).  The camera lenses make me nervous because they stick out.  So, if you don't have a case on it and you place the phone down, the lenses are directly in contact with that surface.  I purchased a Lanhiem Waterproof 360 Full Body Case ($18.99) but it drives me crazy.  I can't stand talking on the phone with it on because the mics are all covered.  Also, it sometimes makes pictures you take less ""crisp"".  It serves it's purpose though.Read more",Neutral

46,"This phone was a last resort. I had a completely failed experience with another seller’s IPhone 11, and to be honest, I was extremely nervous when ordering this one. The reviews had been 50/50, so I had very little clue what I was going to get.The package arrived a day early, which was nice and unexpected. My phone was put into what seemed like a generic Android phone box, which, I’ll let you know damn near gave me a heart attack when I opened.Inside were a few things. An Amazon renewed card and one other thing I can’t remember- as well as the phone (obviously) and a charger and charging brick. Charger and charging brick are standard but the cable feels pretty nice and the brick is a good size. Standard plastic holder inside. Nothing more, nothing less. No complaints.For the actual phone, it was inside of a plastic zip bag. The bag itself was scratched up so it was difficult to see the phone inside until i took it out. The first thing I did when I took it out was inspect it for damage. I was completely ready to pack it back up and send it back- but I was pleasantly surprised.The phone had very little cosmetic damage, just some scratches on the frame (my case covers it anyways, so it doesn’t matter to me) and literally no screen damage- besides a little scratch on the upper right corner near the bezel. And you have to remember these phones are used, so I didn’t feel a need to dock a star for that, since you can only see the scratch when the screen is off and light is being reflected onto it. Overall, 9.5/10 for cosmetics.Then, the battery. My particular phone came with 80% battery health, which I personally don’t mind. I have the means to be able to get it replaced when the time comes, and to be honest was a relief after my last IPhone 11 from another seller had 100% battery health, just for it to be a non-Apple battery and cause all sorts of problems.Overall, I have no complaints with this phone.
